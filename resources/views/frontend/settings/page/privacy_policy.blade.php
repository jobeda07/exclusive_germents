                           To further assist consumers who are worried about how their “Personally Identifiable Information” (PII) is being used online, this privacy policy has been put together. 
                           Information that can be used to identify, reach out to, or find a single person, or to identify a person in context, is referred to as PII in US privacy law and information security. 
                           To fully understand how we gather, utilize, safeguard, or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in compliance with our website, please read our privacy policy carefully.

                            When you register on our site, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, or send us an email, we collect information from you.
                            Only a small group of people with special access permissions to these systems and who have agreed to keep the information confidential 
                            are able to access the guarded networks where your personal information is kept. Additionally, using Secure Socket Layer technology, 
                            all sensitive and credit information you provide is protected.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As needed, we may also ask for your name, email address, mailing address, or phone number when you order or register on our site.
                            When you place an order, we enact a number of security procedures to protect the privacy of your personal information.
                            To make your visit to our site as secure as possible, we regularly scan our website for security flaws and known vulnerabilities.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Your personally identifiable information is never sold, traded, or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties. 
                            This exclusion applies to any trusted third parties with whom we share your information only to the extent necessary to help us operate our website, 
                            carry out our business, or to provide the services you have requested from us. We may also disclose your information if we determine that doing so is 
                            necessary to comply with the law, enforce our site’s rules, or to defend the rights, property, or safety of other people. However, visitor data that 
                            cannot be used to identify an individual may still be shared with third parties for marketing, advertising, or other purposes.
